# Medical Signals Box
#### Embedded system project to collect,send and save medical data with software for receive the data in computers and smart devices.

### Hardware: 
* __Partial Building of Firmware (Hardware test and config)__:
1. ESP32 Bluetooth send data or ble_server.
2. TFT ILI9225 with ESP32 LOLIN32.
3. TTP224 Switch Touch Sensor Digital 4.
4. RTC_DS3231: set time and date, read the time and date now.
5. Get the data of Heart Rate and SpO2 from MAX30102.
6. plot the signal of ECG from AD8232 
7. Display logo of Medical Signals box and more in the start.
8. make Hardware intarface.
9. Develop an Arduino Library to samplify the main code of the firemware. _We focus to this part in the next prototype v2 to focus in education use of the Medical Signals Box_ 
10. MPU-6050 accelerometer and gyroscope. 
* __full building of Firemware__: the firemware writing by c++ and arduino lang<br/>
source code of the firemware here (under development): https://github.com/walidamriou/MedicalSignalsBox/blob/master/Hardware/Firmware/MedicalSignalsBox_version1/MedicalSignalsBox_version1.ino
* __Full building of the hardware__:
1. Circuit: Soon
2. PCB: Soon

### Software: 
* __Partial Building__;
1. __receive the data from the hardware via bluetooth by Nodejs (software/Linux/code.js) in linux (test it in ubuntu 18.04.2)__
2. __receive the data from the hardware via bluetooth by Nodejs (software/Windows/code.js) in Windows (test it in windows 10)__ <br/>
   __Update of 06 may 2019 for the app for Windows:__ there are a problems when I try to program the bluetooth receive in windows, the philosophy of windows with the hardware is not like the linux, in Linux any thing is file for that the play with the hardware is so easy, I will stop develop the app for windows in this time and complete develop the app just in linux, in the future I try to develep it by C#. 
* __Full building__:<br/>
When complete the partial building, I use a methode from prepreprocessor to use the special code for special OS, so when the software run in Linux the software choose the code 1 and when run in windows the software choose the code 2.
